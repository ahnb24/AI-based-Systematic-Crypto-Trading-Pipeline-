# AI-based Systematic Crypto Trading Pipeline  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project implements a systematic crypto-trading pipeline leveraging artificial intelligence and automation. It is designed to collect and process crypto market data, generate features, train and validate ML models (including for real-time deployment), and execute trading decisions in an automated / semi-automated fashion.

Key capabilities include:  
- Data ingestion: historical and real-time crypto price / volume / sentiment data  
- Feature engineering: creation of structured features for model input  
- Model training & validation: machine-learning / deep-learning workflows to predict market moves or strategy signals  
- Real-time deployment: pipeline for live data feed and execution of trading signals  
- MLOps / monitoring: versioning, tracking of experiments, and running in production-like settings  
- Extensible architecture: modular components so you can plug-in new strategies, data sources, models.

## 🎯 Motivation  
The crypto market is characterised by high volatility and rapid changes, making algorithmic and systematic approaches particularly relevant. By applying AI and automation, the goal is to build a repeatable, rigorously-engineered system that:  
- Reduces manual intervention and emotional bias in trading  
- Enables backtesting and live deployment of data-driven strategies  
- Facilitates rapid iteration of features, models and strategies in a pipeline format  
- Bridges the gap between research/prototype and production trading system.

## 🔧 Setup & Installation  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahnb24/AI-based-Systematic-Crypto-Trading-Pipeline-
   cd AI-based-Systematic-Crypto-Trading-Pipeline-
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure necessary credentials and settings (e.g., API keys for market data, exchange access, model tracking).

Run data ingestion and feature generation modules (see features/).

Train and validate model(s) (see models/ / mlops_training/).

Switch to real-time mode to deploy/live trade (carefully!) via realtime/.

📊 Usage Example
bash
Copy code
# Feature generation
python features/create_features.py --input data/raw/historical.csv --output data/processed/features.csv

# Model training
python models/train_model.py --features data/processed/features.csv --model_output models/my_model.pkl

# Live mode (simulated)
python realtime/run_live_pipeline.py --model_path models/my_model.pkl --live_feed=True
🧪 Backtesting & Evaluation
Use historical data to backtest strategy signals generated by your model.

Evaluate performance metrics such as Sharpe ratio, drawdown, win-rate, profit factor.

Compare multiple models / feature sets / strategy variants in the mlops_training/ folder.

🔐 Risk & Disclaimer
Crypto-assets are highly volatile and risky; past performance is not indicative of future results.

This project is for educational / research purposes only and not financial advice.

If you deploy live trading, ensure proper risk management, capital controls, regulatory compliance and monitoring.

🧩 Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues, propose new features (e.g., new data sources, models, execution modules), or submit pull requests.
Please follow style guidelines, include tests for new modules, and document changes in the docs/ folder (if created).
